# Synergy-Framework-GTA

## Description
This is a mod menu project for GTA, developed by **xiBryan**. The original base was created by **Jordy** and converted by me for GTA. The project is unfinished and has limited features, but it includes an **Anti-Freeze** system that protects against approximately 95% of existing freezes, with contributions from **dontcry** and **Ventura**.

## Project Status
I, **xiBryan**, have released the source code of this project as I no longer plan to work on it. The source is available for anyone who wishes to continue development or use it as a base for other projects.

## Credits
- **xiBryan**: Creator and main developer.
- **dontcry**: Contributions to the Anti-Freeze system.
- **Ventura**: Contributions to the Anti-Freeze system.
- **Jordy**: Creator of the original base used in the project.

## Disclaimer
This project is provided "as is." I offer no support or future updates. Use at your own risk.
